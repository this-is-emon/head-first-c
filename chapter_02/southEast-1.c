- The game will track the location of players using latitudes and 
longitudes. The latitude is how far north(Up) or south(Down) the player 
is, and the longitude is her position east(Right) or west(Left). If a player 
wants to travel southeast, that means her latitude will go down, 
and her longitude will go up:

  - what happens if you pass their addresses(means variable itself)?
  - Trying to pass a pointer to the variable,may full-fill that purpose.
